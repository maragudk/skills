# Save web page

You can use the `monolith` CLI tool to save a web page for offline use.

The core command to use is `monolith --isolate -o <name>.html <url>`.

Prefer saving to the ~/AI/web/ directory unless instructed otherwise.

If you need to do anything else with the command, use `monolith -h` to see its uses.
