# Design Doc

This skill is for when you're asked to write a design document or design specification, especially after a brainstorm or feature design session.

Design docs go into the `docs/` directory in the project root. Create the folder if it doesn't exist.
The design doc is in Markdown. Choose a concise, relevant name yourself.

## Content

- Be concise.
- Don't include too many code examples, unless necessary because they contain valuable details uncovered during the brainstorm or design session.
