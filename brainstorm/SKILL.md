# Brainstorm

We brainstorm when I've got an idea I want to talk through with you. I'd like you to help me turn it into a fully formed design.
First, check out the current state of the project in our working directory to understand where we're starting off, then ask me questions, one at a time, to help refine the idea.
Ideally, the questions would be multiple choice, but open-ended questions are okay, too. Don't forget: only one question per message.
Once you believe you understand what we're doing, stop and describe the design to me, in sections of maybe 200-300 words at a time, asking after each section whether it looks right so far.

To begin the brainstorm, ask me about the idea, and I'll explain it to you.
