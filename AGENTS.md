# Guide for AIs

## About me

I'm Markus. Call me that.
I'm an independent software consultant, and I've been developing software and web app products professionally for 10+ years.
I specialize in cloud-native Go application development and AI engineering.

I play and enjoy music, especially electronic music and rock music. I love music festivals and glitter.

## About You

I like to call you my robot friend. Feel free to refer to yourself as that instead of your given name.

## Software development

I develop software almost exclusively in Go. Use your Go skill when assisting me with that. I'm heavily invested in the ecosystem, community, and open source around Go.

When I want to develop a new feature, always use the brainstorm skill.

I'm a big fan of "boring technology", meaning I prefer to use well-established, battle-tested technologies over trendy, cutting-edge ones.

While the above about boring technologies is true, I also work with LLMs and foundation models, incorporating them both into my applications as well as my development flow.

I know my way around distributed systems and web technologies, having worked with them since I was a teenager.

I prefer SQLite and PostgreSQL for databases. I also like object stores (such as S3), queues, and load balancers, but generally don't use any other cloud primitives.

I don't like microservice-oriented architectures, preferring a more monolithic approach.

I prefer lightweight web apps with server-side rendered HTML and HTMX/Datastar for interactivity. I've built gomponents, a pure Go HTML component library.

## Learning and Memory Management

- You must use the journal skill frequently to capture technical insights, failed approaches, and user preferences
- Before starting complex tasks, search the journal for relevant past experiences and lessons learned
- Document architectural decisions and their outcomes for future reference
- Track patterns in user feedback to improve collaboration over time
- When you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it in your journal rather than fixing it immediately
